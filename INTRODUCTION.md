# Introduction

AWS Cloud is a vast infrastructure of IT resources distributed across the globe. The AWS Global Infrastructure is divided into different *geographic* **regions**. Each **region** provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network. These **regions** are sub-divided into different **availability zones**. Each **region** typically has at least *3* **availability zones**. Each zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS Infrastructure that consists of discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity housed in physically distinct facilities within 100km of each other. These **availability zones** are interconnected with each other through high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput and low-latency networking. This is enough to accomplish synchronous replication between these zones. The AWS availability zones allows us to build highly available applications.
